# Perl from Java

Execute a Perl script from Java.  The action for this repo runs a Java program
that calls a Perl script which writes a message to a file. After the Java program has
finished the action prints the content of the file to show the message written by Perl when called from Java.

With a lot of help from Mike Limberger!
